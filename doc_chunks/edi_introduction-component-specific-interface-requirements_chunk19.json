  "content": "#### Access\n\nThe access activity within the Big Data Application Provider is focused\non the communication/interaction with the Data Consumer. Like the\ncollection activity, the access activity may be a generic service such\nas a web server or application server that is configured by the System\nOrchestrator to handle specific requests from the Data Consumer. This\nactivity would interface with the visualization and analytic activities\nto respond to requests from the Data Consumer (who may be a person) and\nuses the processing and platform frameworks to retrieve data to respond\nto Data Consumer requests. In addition, the access activity confirms\nthat descriptive and administrative metadata and metadata schemes are\ncaptured and maintained for access by the Data Consumer and as data is\ntransferred to the Data Consumer. The interface with the Data Consumer\nmay be synchronous or asynchronous in nature and may use a pull or push\nparadigm for data transfer.",

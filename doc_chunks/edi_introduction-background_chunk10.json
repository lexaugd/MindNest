  "content": "During Stage 2, the NBD-PWG developed Version 2 of the NBDIF Version 1\nvolumes, with the exception of Volume 5, which contained the completed\narchitecture survey work that was used to inform Stage 1 work of the\nNBD-PWG.  The goals of Version 2 were to enhance the Version 1\ncontent, define general interfaces between the NBDRA components by\naggregating low-level interactions into high-level general interfaces,\nand demonstrate how the NBDRA can be used. As a result of the Stage 2\nwork, the need for NBDIF Volume 8 and NBDIF Volume 9 were identified\nand the two new volumes were created. Version 2 of the NBDIF volumes,\nresulting from Stage 2 work, can be downloaded from the V2.0 Final\nVersion page of the NBD-PWG website [@www-nist-bdra-v2-wegpage].",

However, the working group has shown \nmultiple solutions to this as part of cloudmesh. This includes the posibility\nof a \n\n* *Local configuration file:* A configuration file is managed locally to\n  allow access to the clouds. It is the designer's responsibility\n  not to expose such credentials.\n* *Session based authentication:* No passwords are stored in the\n  configuration file and access is granted on a per session basis where\n  the password needs to be entered.\n* *Service based authentication:* The authentication is delegated to an\n  external process. The service that acts on behalf\n  of the user needs to have access to the appropriate cloud provider \n  credentials\n\nAn example for a configuration file is provided at [@cloudmesh4-yaml].",

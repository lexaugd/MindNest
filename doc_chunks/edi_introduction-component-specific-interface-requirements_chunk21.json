  "content": "#### Platforms Interface Requirements\n\nAs part of the NBDRA platforms, interfaces are needed that can address\nplatform needs and services for data organization, data distribution,\nindexed storage, and file systems.\n\n#### Processing Interface Requirements\n\nThe processing frameworks for Big Data provide the necessary\ninfrastructure software to support implementation of applications that\ncan deal with the volume, velocity, variety, and variability of data.\nProcessing frameworks define how the computation and processing of the\ndata is organized. Big Data applications rely on various platforms and\ntechnologies to meet the challenges of scalable data analytics and\noperation. A requirement is the ability to interface easily with\ncomputing services that offer specific analytics services, batch\nprocessing capabilities, interactive analysis, and data streaming.\n\n#### Crosscutting Interface Requirements",

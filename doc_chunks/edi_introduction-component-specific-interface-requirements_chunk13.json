  "content": "#### Preparation\n\nThe preparation activity is where the transformation portion of the\nETL/ELT cycle is likely performed, although analytics activity will also\nlikely perform advanced parts of the transformation. Tasks performed by\nthis activity could include data validation (e.g., checksums/hashes,\nformat checks), cleaning (e.g., eliminating bad records/fields),\noutlier removal, standardization, reformatting, or encapsulating. This\nactivity is also where source data will frequently be persisted to\narchive storage in the Big Data Framework Provider and provenance data\nwill be verified or attached/associated. Verification or attachment may\ninclude optimization of data through manipulations (e.g., deduplication)\nand indexing to optimize the analytics process. This activity may also\naggregate data from different Data Providers, leveraging metadata keys\nto create an expanded and enhanced data set.\n\n#### Analytics",

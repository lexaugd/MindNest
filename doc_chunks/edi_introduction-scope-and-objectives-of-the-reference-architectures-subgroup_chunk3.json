  "content": "The NBDRA is a high-level conceptual model crafted to serve as a tool to\nfacilitate open discussion of the requirements, design structures, and\noperations inherent in Big Data. The NBDRA is intended to facilitate the\nunderstanding of the operational intricacies in Big Data. It does not\nrepresent the system architecture of a specific Big Data system, but\nrather is a tool for describing, discussing, and developing\nsystem-specific architectures using a common framework of reference. The\nmodel is not tied to any specific vendor products, services, or\nreference implementation, nor does it define prescriptive solutions that\ninhibit innovation.\n\nThe NBDRA does not address the following:\n\n* Detailed specifications for any organization's operational systems;\n* Detailed specifications of information exchanges or services; and\n* Recommendations or standards for integration of infrastructure\n  products.",

As not every infrastructure is\nsuited for every use case, a custom infrastructure may be needed. As\nsuch, this document is not attempting to deliver a single deployed\nNBDRA, but allow the setup of an infrastructure that satisfies the\nparticular use case. To achieve this task, it is necessary to\nprovision software stacks and services while orchestrating their\ndeployment and leveraging infrastructures. It is not the focus of this\ndocument to replace existing orchestration software and services, but\nprovide an interface to them to leverage them as part of defining and\ncreating the infrastructure. Various orchestration frameworks and\nservices could therefore be leveraged, even as part of the same",

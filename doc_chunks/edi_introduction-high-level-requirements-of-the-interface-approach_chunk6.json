  "content": "The creation of the infrastructure suitable for Big Data applications\nprovides the basic computing environment. However, Big Data applications\nmay require the creation of sophisticated applications as part of\ninteractive experiments to analyze and probe the data. For this purpose,\nthe applications must be able to orchestrate and interact with\nexperiments conducted on the data while assuring reproducibility and\ncorrectness of the data. For this purpose, a *System Orchestrator*\n(either the data scientists or a service acting on behalf of the data\nscientist) is used as the command center to interact on behalf of the\nBig Data Application Provider to orchestrate dataflow from Data\nProvider, carry out the Big Data application life cycle with the help of\nthe Big Data Framework Provider, and enable the Data Consumer to consume\nBig Data processing results. An interface is needed to describe these\ninteractions and to allow leveraging of experiment management frameworks",

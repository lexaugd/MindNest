  "content": "The analytics activity of the Big Data Application Provider includes the\nencoding of the low-level business logic of the Big Data system (with\nhigher-level business process logic being encoded by the System\nOrchestrator). The activity implements the techniques to extract\nknowledge from the data based on the requirements of the vertical\napplication. The requirements specify the data processing algorithms to\nproduce new insights that will address the technical goal. The analytics\nactivity will leverage the processing frameworks to implement the\nassociated logic. This typically involves the activity providing\nsoftware that implements the analytic logic to the batch and/or\nstreaming elements of the processing framework for execution. The\nmessaging/communication framework of the Big Data Framework Provider may\nbe used to pass data or control functions to the application logic\nrunning in the processing frameworks. The analytic logic may be broken",

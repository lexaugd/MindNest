  "content": "## Interface Compliancy\n\nDue to the easy extensibility of the resource objects specified in this \ndocument and their interfaces, it is important to introduce a \nterminology that allows the definition of interface compliancy. We define\nthree levels of interface compliance as follows:\n\n* **Full Compliance:** These are reference implementations that provide\n  full compliance to the objects defined in this document. A version\n  number is added to assure that the snapshot in time of the\n  objects is associated with the version. A full complient framework \n  implements all objects.",

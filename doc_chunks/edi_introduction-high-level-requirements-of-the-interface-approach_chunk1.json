  "content": "## High-Level Requirements of the Interface Approach\n\n\nThis section focuses on the high-level requirements of the interface\napproach that are needed to implement the reference architecture\ndepicted in @fig:arch.\n\n### Technology- and Vendor-Agnostic\n\nDue to the many different tools, services, and infrastructures\navailable in the general area of Big Data, an interface ought to be as\nvendor-independent as possible, while, at the same time, be able to\nleverage best practices. Hence, a methodology is needed that allows\nextension of interfaces to adapt and leverage existing approaches, but\nalso allows the interfaces to provide merit in easy specifications\nthat assist the formulation and definition of the NBDRA.\n\n### Support of Plug-In Compute Infrastructure",

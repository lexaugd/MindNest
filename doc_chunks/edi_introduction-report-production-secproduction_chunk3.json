  "content": "To enable interoperability between the NBDRA components, a list of\nwell-defined NBDRA interfaces is needed. These interfaces are documented\nin this volume. To introduce them, the NBDRA structure will be followed,\nfocusing on interfaces that allow bootstrapping of the NBDRA. The\ndocument begins with a summary of requirements that will be integrated\ninto our specifications. Subsequently, each section will introduce a\nnumber of objects that build the core of the interface addressing a\nspecific aspect of the NBDRA. A selected number of *interface use cases*\nwill be showcased to outline how the specific interface can be used in a\nreference implementation of the NBDRA. Validation of this approach can\nbe achieved while applying it to the application use cases that have\nbeen gathered in the *NBDIF: Volume 3, Use Cases and Requirements*\ndocument. These application use cases have considerably contributed\ntowards the design of the NBDRA. Hence the expectation is that: (1) the",

This reference\n  implementation implements a partial list of the objects and interfaces. A\n  document is to be added that specifies the differences to a full complient \n  implementation. \n  \n* **Extended Compliance:** In addition to full and partial compliance \n  additional resources can be identified while documenting additional \n  resource objects and interfaces that are not included in the current \n  specification. The extended complience document can lead to additional \n  improvements of the current specification.",

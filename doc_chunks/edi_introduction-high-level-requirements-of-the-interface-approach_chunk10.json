Consequently, the\ninterfaces defined herein can be augmented with frameworks and\nsolutions that provide such mechanisms.  Thus, diverse requirement\nneeds stemming from different use cases addressing security need to be\ndistinguished. To contrast that the security requirements between\napplications can vary drastically, the following example is\nprovided. Although many of the interfaces and their objects to support\nBig Data applications in physics are similar to those in healthcare,\nthey differ in the integration of security interfaces and\npolicies. While in physics the protection of data is less of an issue,\nit is a stringent requirement in healthcare. Thus, deriving",

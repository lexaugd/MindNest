Two fabrics envelop the\ncomponents, representing the interwoven nature of management and\nsecurity and privacy with all five of the components. These two fabrics\nprovide services and functionality to the five main roles in the areas\nspecific to Big Data and are crucial to any Big Data solution. Note:\nNone of the terminology or diagrams in these documents is intended to be\nnormative or to imply any business or deployment model. The terms\n*provider* and *consumer* as used are descriptive of general roles and\nare meant to be informative in nature.",

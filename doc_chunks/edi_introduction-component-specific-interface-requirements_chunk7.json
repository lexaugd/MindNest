New data feeds are distinct from the data already in use by\nthe system and residing in the various system repositories. Similar\ntechnologies can be used to access both new data feeds and existing\ndata. The Data Provider actors can be anything from a sensor, to a human\ninputting data manually, to another Big Data system. Interfaces for data\nproviders must be able to specify a data provider so it can be located\nby a data consumer. It also must include enough details to identify the\nservices offered so they can be pragmatically reused by consumers.\nInterfaces to describe pipes and filters must be addressed.\n\n### Data Consumer Interface Requirements {#sec:data-consumer-requirements}",

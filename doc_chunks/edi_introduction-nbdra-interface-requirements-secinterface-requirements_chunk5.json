  "content": "The DATA arrows in @fig:arch show the flow of data between the system's\nmain roles. Data flows between the roles either physically (i.e., by\nvalue) or by providing its location and the means to access it (i.e., by\nreference). The SW arrows show transfer of software tools for processing\nof Big Data *in situ*. The Service Use arrows represent software\nprogrammable interfaces. While the main focus of the NBDRA is to\nrepresent the run-time environment, all three types of communications or\ntransactions can happen in the configuration phase as well. Manual\nagreements (e.g., service-level agreements) and human interactions that\nmay exist throughout the system are not shown in the NBDRA.\n\nDetailed information on the NBDRA conceptual model is presented in the\n*NBDIF: Volume 6, Reference Architecture* document.\n\nPrior to outlining the specific interfaces, general requirements are\nintroduced and the interfaces are defined.",

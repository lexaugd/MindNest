The\noverall goals of this volume are to define and specify interfaces to\nimplement the Big Data Reference Architecture. This volume arose from\ndiscussions during the weekly NBD-PWG conference calls. Topics included\nin this volume began to take form in Phase 2 of the NBD-PWG work. During \nthe discussions, the NBD-PWG identified the need to\nspecify a variety of interfaces.\n\n\nPhase 3 work, which built upon the groundwork developed during Phase 2, \nincluded an early specification based on resource object specifications \nthat provided a simplified version of an API interface design.",

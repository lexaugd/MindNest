This interface must be\nable to provide the following functionality:\n\n* Interfaces to files,\n* Interfaces to virtual data directories,\n* Interfaces to data streams, and\n* Interfaces to data filters.\n\n#### Infrastructures Interface Requirements\n\nThis Big Data Framework Provider element provides all the resources\nnecessary to host/run the activities of the other components of the Big\nData system. Typically, these resources consist of some combination of\nphysical resources, which may host/support similar virtual resources.\nThe NBDRA needs interfaces that can be used to deal with the underlying\ninfrastructure to address networking, computing, and storage.\n\n#### Platforms Interface Requirements",

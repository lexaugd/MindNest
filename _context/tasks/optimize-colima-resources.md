# OPTIMIZE COLIMA RESOURCES FOR AI MODELS

## SUMMARY
Configure Colima with maximum resources for running high-performance LLM models while maintaining system stability.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Allocate maximum safe resources to Colima VM
- Ensure host system remains responsive
- Optimize for running large language models
- Configure memory, CPU, and disk for optimal performance

## FILE TREE:
- docker-setup.md - Documentation for Docker setup with Colima

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Hardware Specifications
- MacBook Pro Model: Mac14,6 (MNWA3LL/A)
- CPU: 12 cores (8 performance, 4 efficiency)
- RAM: 32GB total
- Disk: 926GB with 608GB available

### Current Colima Configuration
- CPU: 2 cores
- Memory: 2GB
- Disk: 100GB

### Optimal Resource Allocation
For running large language models while maintaining system stability:

1. **CPU Allocation**: 
   - Allocate 8 cores out of 12 total
   - Leave 4 cores for system operations
   - Reasoning: This provides substantial compute power while keeping efficiency cores for system tasks

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Allocate 24GB out of 32GB total
   - Leave 8GB for system operations
   - Reasoning: LLMs are memory-intensive; 24GB allows for running larger models while keeping system responsive

3. **Disk Allocation**:
   - Allocate 200GB out of 608GB available
   - Reasoning: Increased from 100GB to accommodate larger model files and datasets

4. **Additional Optimizations**:
   - Enable Rosetta 2 for improved performance on ARM architecture
   - Configure with reachable network address for easier access
   - Set VM type to 'vz' (Virtualization.Framework) for better performance

### Safety Measures
- System can be returned to default settings with: `colima stop && colima start`
- Resource monitoring is recommended during initial usage
- If system becomes unstable, reduce memory to 20GB and CPU to 6 cores

## TODO LIST
[x] Stop current Colima instance
[x] Start Colima with optimized settings for CPU, memory, and disk
[x] Verify configuration is applied correctly
[x] Document the updated configuration in docker-setup.md 
[ ] Test system stability with the new configuration

colima start --cpu 8 --memory 24 --disk 200 --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta --network-address

## MEETING NOTES
- Successfully stopped Colima instance
- Applied optimized settings with 8 CPUs, 24GB memory, and 200GB disk
- Verified new configuration with 'colima list' command
- Updated docker-setup.md with the new optimized configuration section
- Next step: User to test system stability with the new configuration

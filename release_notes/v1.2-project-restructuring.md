# MindNest v1.2: Project Restructuring and Optimization

**Release Date**: August 2024  
**Type**: Infrastructure Update  
**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

This release focuses on improving the project structure, organization, and maintainability of MindNest. We've made significant changes to streamline the codebase, clean up redundant files, reorganize requirements, and improve documentation consistency. These changes make the project more accessible to new developers and easier to maintain for existing contributors.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dependency Management Overhaul

- Reorganized requirements into a hierarchical structure:
  - `requirements/base.txt`: Common dependencies needed in all environments
  - `requirements/production.txt`: Dependencies for production use (extends base.txt)
  - `requirements/development.txt`: Dependencies for development (extends production.txt)
  - `requirements/lightweight.txt`: Minimal dependencies for lightweight mode
- Updated main requirements.txt to point to production requirements
- Improved version pinning consistency
- Fixed dependency conflicts (resolved huggingface-hub version constraints)
- Streamlined installation options
- Removed redundant test dependencies from main requirements

### 2. File Organization

- Moved utility scripts to a dedicated `scripts/` directory
- Centralized documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Removed duplicate files from root directory
- Consolidated Docker-related files in the `docker/` directory
- Renamed configuration files to follow standard conventions (e.g., `.env.example`)

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md to reflect new project structure
- Updated installation instructions for different environments
- Added comprehensive project structure documentation
- Ensured documentation consistency with implementation
- Fixed outdated references and paths

### 4. Codebase Cleanup

- Removed redundant files and code
- Deleted outdated test files
- Fixed import paths in moved files
- Maintained backward compatibility for key entry points
- Eliminated duplicate functionality

## Technical Details

### Requirements Structure

The new requirements structure uses a hierarchical approach:

```
requirements/
├── base.txt            # Common dependencies for all environments
├── production.txt      # Extends base.txt with production dependencies
├── development.txt     # Extends production.txt with development tools
└── lightweight.txt     # Minimal dependencies for lightweight mode

requirements.txt        # Root file that points to production requirements
```

Sample usage in `requirements.txt`:
```
# Main requirements file for MindNest
# 
# This file redirects to the production requirements.
# For other environments:
# - Development: pip install -r requirements/development.txt
# - Lightweight: pip install -r requirements/lightweight.txt

-r requirements/production.txt
```

### Directory Structure Improvements

The streamlined directory structure provides better organization:

```
MindNest/
├── docs/               # All documentation (moved from root)
├── mindnest/           # Main package code
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts (moved from root)
├── tests/              # Test suite
├── docker/             # Docker configuration files
└── requirements/       # Organized requirements files
```

### Redundant File Cleanup

Several redundant files were identified and removed:

- Removed `docker-compose.yml` from root (duplicate of `docker/docker-compose.yml`)
- Removed `run_direct.py` (redundant with `run_server.py`)
- Removed `run_tests.py` from root (duplicate of script version)
- Moved `query_docs.py` to scripts directory
- Moved `docker-setup.md` to docs directory
- Cleaned up outdated test files

## Upgrade Instructions

This update focuses on project structure and doesn't affect core functionality. To upgrade:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Upgrade dependencies with the appropriate requirements file:
   ```bash
   # For standard installation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For development environment
   pip install -r requirements/development.txt
   
   # For lightweight mode
   pip install -r requirements/lightweight.txt
   ```
3. Update any scripts that referenced moved files to use the new paths

## Breaking Changes

- Requirements management has changed - use the appropriate requirements file for your environment
- Some utility scripts have moved from the root directory to `scripts/`
- Docker configuration is now exclusively in the `docker/` directory

## Testing Results

The restructured project was thoroughly tested to ensure no functionality was lost:

- All unit tests pass with the new structure
- Docker container builds and runs correctly
- Application starts and responds to queries as expected
- Imports and file references work correctly with the new paths

## Future Plans

Future improvements related to project structure:

- Complete conversion to pyproject.toml-based project configuration
- Further modularization of the codebase
- Implementation of pluggable architecture for document processors and model types
- Improved CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment

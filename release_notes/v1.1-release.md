# MindNest v1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: April 2024  
**Type**: Feature and Stability Update  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

MindNest v1.1 delivers significant improvements to AI response accuracy, document processing, and overall system stability. This release introduces model-aware processing, context window optimization, comprehensive testing, and multiple launcher options to ensure more consistent and accurate results when querying documentation.

## Major Features

### 1. AI Response Accuracy Improvements

- **Context Window Optimization**: 
  - Intelligent document truncation based on model capabilities
  - Different strategies for small vs. large models
  - Prevents token limit overflows for more reliable responses
  - Improved token estimation for better content fitting

- **Model-Specific Processing**:
  - Centralized `LLMManager` for handling model capabilities
  - Optimized prompt templates for different model sizes
  - Adjusted document retrieval limits based on model capabilities
  - Query categorization with model-specific thresholds

- **Quality Control Mechanisms**:
  - Validation checks for potentially low-quality responses
  - Fallback mechanisms for uncertain outputs
  - Confidence assessment for hybrid response generation
  - Consistent formatting for better readability

### 2. Document Organization Tools

- **Document Cleanup Utilities** (`cleanup_docs.py`):
  - Script for removing duplicate content
  - Tools for cleaning placeholder files
  - Document splitting based on semantic content

- **Semantic Document Chunking** (`doc_chunker.py`):
  - Processes documents into coherent chunks
  - Preserves metadata for better retrieval
  - Uses advanced RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

### 3. Multiple Launch Options

- **Python Launcher** (`mindnest_launcher.py`):
  - Comprehensive command-line options
  - Automatic dependency detection and installation
  - Model switching capabilities
  - Environment verification

- **Shell Script Launcher** (`run.sh`):
  - Support for both direct and Docker launches
  - Docker container management commands
  - Lightweight mode options
  - Browser control settings

- **Direct Runner** (`run_direct.py`):
  - Simplified direct execution
  - Lightweight model options
  - Custom port and host configuration

### 4. Enhanced Docker Support

- **Optimized Docker Configuration**:
  - Docker Compose support for easier deployment
  - Resource optimization for AI model performance
  - Colima configuration for macOS (alternative to Docker Desktop)
  - Shell script commands for container management

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Context optimization testing
  - Document processing verification
  - Configuration management tests

- **Test Runner**:
  - Easy-to-use test runner script
  - Automatically discovers and runs all tests
  - Clear reporting of test results

## Technical Improvements

- **Modular Architecture**:
  - Reorganized utility modules for better maintenance
  - Clear separation of concerns between components
  - Improved error handling and logging

- **Enhanced Query Processing**:
  - More accurate query classification
  - Better handling of different query types
  - Optimized response generation for each query type

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Improved caching mechanisms
  - More efficient document retrieval
  - Reduced response times for common queries

- **Project Structure**:
  - Better organization of components
  - Clear distinction between core and utility files
  - Deprecation of legacy components

## Upgrade Instructions

1. Update from the repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Install updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test suite to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   ```

4. Start the application using your preferred method:
   ```bash
   # Standard launch
   python mindnest_launcher.py
   
   # OR via shell script
   ./run.sh start
   
   # OR Docker deployment
   ./run.sh docker:start
   ```

## Compatibility Notes

- This release is fully compatible with existing document collections
- No database migration is required
- Configuration from previous versions will continue to work
- For optimal performance, review the updated configuration options

## Deprecated Components

The following components are marked for removal in a future release:
- `basic_app_with_docs.py` - Replaced by the modular architecture
- `test_docs.py` - Replaced by the comprehensive test suite

## Future Roadmap

- Enhanced semantic search with hybrid dense-sparse embeddings
- Cross-document reference tracking
- Advanced document quality assessment
- User interface improvements
- Multi-model inference options

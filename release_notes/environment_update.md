# Environment Configuration Update

## Overview
This document describes the process of updating the environment configuration for MindNest v1.0, transitioning from an outdated configuration approach to the new centralized configuration system.

## Previous Configuration
The previous configuration used a simple `.env` file with only one setting:
```
MODEL_PATH=models/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

This approach was limited and did not align with the new configuration system implemented in v1.0.

## New Configuration System
The v1.0 release includes a centralized configuration system with:
- A comprehensive `utils/config.py` module that manages all application settings
- Environment variable overrides for all configuration options
- An `env.example` template file with all available settings documented

## Update Process

### Step 1: Identify Existing Configuration
We first examined the existing environment setup:
```bash
ls -la | grep .env
```
This revealed both the old `.env` file and the new `env.example` template.

### Step 2: Review Configuration Contents
We examined the contents of the old `.env` file:
```bash
cat .env
# Output: MODEL_PATH=models/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

We also reviewed the new `env.example` template, which contains a complete set of configuration options.

### Step 3: Replace Configuration File
We removed the old `.env` file and created a new one based on the template:
```bash
rm .env
cp env.example .env
```

### Step 4: Test the Application
We tested that the application works correctly with the new configuration by:
1. Starting the server with `python run_server.py`
2. Verifying the server health with `curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/health`
3. Checking the configuration with `curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/config`
4. Testing various query types to ensure correct functionality

## Test Results
The application successfully started with the new configuration:
- The vector store was properly initialized with 22 documents
- The health check returned `{"status":"healthy","llm":"loaded","vectorstore":"loaded","model":"Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored.Q4_K_M.gguf"}`
- The configuration endpoint returned the expected values
- LLM was successfully loaded with the correct context window (4096) and batch size (1024)

### Model Information
The LLM successfully loaded with the following parameters:
- Model type: 13B (Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored)
- Context window: 4096 tokens (configurable via CONTEXT_WINDOW)
- Batch size: 1024 tokens (configurable via BATCH_SIZE)
- GPU acceleration: Metal for Apple Silicon

### Query Testing
We tested various query types:
1. Regular document queries
2. Specific content queries
3. File-specific queries
4. Document search queries
5. Unrelated queries
6. Concise requests

All query types were processed correctly, with proper query classification and caching.

### Cache Performance
The caching system performed excellently:
- Memory hits: 100% hit rate for repeated queries
- Cache statistics showed proper tracking
- Query classifier cache functioned correctly

## Conclusion
The transition to the new configuration system was successful. The application now uses a more comprehensive and flexible configuration approach that aligns with the improvements described in the v1.0 release notes. The enhanced configuration system works seamlessly with all aspects of the application, from LLM initialization to document processing and query handling.

# MindNest v1.0 Release Notes

## Overview
We're excited to announce the release of MindNest v1.0, a comprehensive AI-powered documentation system for codebases. This release includes significant improvements to the architecture, performance, and usability of the application.

## Key Improvements

### Configuration Management
- Created a centralized config module with environment variable overrides
- Added better documentation of configuration options
- Created an `env.example` file for easier configuration
- Successfully tested the new configuration system with various query types
- Verified correct context window (4096) and batch size (1024) settings

### Logging System
- Implemented a robust logging system with rotation
- Added standardized logging across all modules
- Configured both console and file-based logging

### Code Organization
- Established proper module structure
- Implemented separation of concerns
- Removed redundant code (basic_app_with_docs.py and test_docs.py)

### Document Processing
- Consolidated document loading into a single module
- Added better error handling for document processing
- Improved file type detection and support

### Vector Store Management
- Enhanced incremental updates to avoid full rebuilds
- Added better tracking of document changes
- Implemented support for deleting documents

### Query Cache
- Implemented LRU caching with configurable size limits
- Added disk persistence for cache durability
- Improved cache statistics tracking
- Verified cache performance with 100% hit rate for repeated queries

### LLM Management
- Centralized LLM initialization
- Added better error handling for missing models
- Enhanced chain creation with improved prompts
- Optimized Metal acceleration for Apple Silicon
- Added model switching capability for different performance needs (see `release_notes/model_switching.md`)

### Data Models
- Created Pydantic models for all data structures
- Added validation and documentation of models
- Improved type safety throughout the application

### Testing Infrastructure
- Added proper unit test structure and runner
- Created tests for key components
- Implemented test discovery with the test runner
- Comprehensive testing of various query types and API endpoints

### Documentation
- Improved README with more detailed information
- Added comprehensive environment variable documentation
- Enhanced code comments and docstrings
- Created detailed release notes and update guides
- Added documentation for model switching and use cases

## Upgrading
To upgrade to this version, please follow the instructions in the README.md file. Make sure to review the `env.example` file for new configuration options.

**Important:** If upgrading from a previous version, you'll need to replace your old `.env` file with the new format. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings. The old format is no longer compatible with the centralized configuration system. See `release_notes/environment_update.md` for details on this process.

## User Interface Improvements
- Added model switching capability in the settings panel (see `release_notes/model_switching.md`)
- Improved settings panel with more configuration options
- Enhanced query processing with better response formatting
- Added system notifications for configuration changes

## Known Issues
- Large language models require significant memory
- Best performance with codebases under 10,000 files

## Future Plans
- Add support for more document formats
- Implement user authentication
- Enhance the web interface with more interactive features

## Test Results
We've thoroughly tested this release with a variety of query types:
- Document queries work correctly with proper source attribution
- Query classification system accurately identifies query intent
- LLM responses maintain consistency across different query types
- Cache system shows excellent performance with repeated queries
- GPU acceleration works properly on Apple Silicon
- LLM loads with the correct context window (4096) and batch size (1024)

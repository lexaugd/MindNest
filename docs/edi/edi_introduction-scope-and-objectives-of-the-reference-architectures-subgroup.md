## Scope and Objectives of the Reference Architectures Subgroup

Reference architectures provide "an authoritative source of
information about a specific subject area that guides and constrains
the instantiations of multiple architectures and solutions"
[@www-dodaf-arch]. Reference architectures generally serve as a
foundation for solution architectures and may also be used for
comparison and alignment of instantiations of architectures and
solutions.

The goal of the NBD-PWG Reference Architecture Subgroup is to develop an
open reference architecture for Big Data that achieves the following
objectives:

* Provides a common language for the various stakeholders;
* Encourages adherence to common standards, specifications, and
   patterns;
* Provides consistent methods for implementation of technology to
  solve similar problem sets;
* Illustrates and improves understanding of the various Big Data
  components, processes, and systems, in the context of a vendor- and
  technology-agnostic Big Data conceptual model;
* Provides a technical reference for U.S. government departments,
  agencies, and other consumers to understand, discuss, categorize,
  and compare Big Data solutions; and
* Facilitates analysis of candidate standards for interoperability,
  portability, reusability, and extendibility.

The NBDRA is a high-level conceptual model crafted to serve as a tool to
facilitate open discussion of the requirements, design structures, and
operations inherent in Big Data. The NBDRA is intended to facilitate the
understanding of the operational intricacies in Big Data. It does not
represent the system architecture of a specific Big Data system, but
rather is a tool for describing, discussing, and developing
system-specific architectures using a common framework of reference. The
model is not tied to any specific vendor products, services, or
reference implementation, nor does it define prescriptive solutions that
inhibit innovation.

The NBDRA does not address the following:

* Detailed specifications for any organization's operational systems;
* Detailed specifications of information exchanges or services; and
* Recommendations or standards for integration of infrastructure
  products.

The goals of the Subgroup were realized throughout the three planned
phases of the NBD-PWG work, as outlined in @sec:production.

## Design by Resource-Oriented Architecture

A resource-oriented architecture represents a software architecture
and programming paradigm for designing and developing software in the
form of resources. It is often associated with *REpresentational State
Transfer (REST)* interfaces. The resources are software components
which can be reused in concrete reference implementations. The service
specification is conducted with OpenAPI, allowing use to provide it in
a very general form that is independent of the framework or computer
language in which the services can be specified.  Note that OpenAPI
defines services in REST The previous version only specified the
resource objects.

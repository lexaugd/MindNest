## Background

There is broad agreement among commercial, academic, and government
leaders about the potential of Big Data to spark innovation,
fuel commerce, and drive progress. Big Data is the common term used to
describe the deluge of data in today's networked, digitized,
sensor-laden, and information-driven world. The availability of vast
data resources carries the potential to answer questions previously out
of reach, including the following:

* How can a potential pandemic reliably be detected early enough to
  intervene?
* Can new materials with advanced properties be predicted before these
  materials have ever been synthesized?
* How can the current advantage of the attacker over the defender in
  guarding against cybersecurity threats be reversed?

There is also broad agreement on the ability of Big Data to overwhelm
traditional approaches. The growth rates for data volumes, speeds, and
complexity are outpacing scientific and technological advances in data
analytics, management, transport, and data user spheres.

Despite widespread agreement on the inherent opportunities and current
limitations of Big Data, a lack of consensus on some important
fundamental questions continues to confuse potential users and stymie
progress. These questions include the following:

* How is Big Data defined?
* What attributes define Big Data solutions?
* What is new in Big Data?
* What is the difference between Big Data and *bigger data* that has
  been collected for years?
* How is Big Data different from traditional data environments and
  related applications?
* What are the essential characteristics of Big Data environments?
* How do these environments integrate with currently deployed
  architectures?
* What are the central scientific, technological, and standardization
  challenges that need to be addressed to accelerate the deployment of
  robust, secure Big Data solutions?

Within this context, on March 29, 2012, the White House announced the
Big Data Research and Development Initiative (The White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy, "Big Data is a Big Deal," *OSTP
Blog*, accessed February 21, 2014 [@www-whitehous-bigdata].  The
initiative's goals include helping to accelerate the pace of discovery
in science and engineering, strengthening national security, and
transforming teaching and learning by improving analysts' ability to
extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of
digital data.

Six federal departments and their agencies announced more than $200
million in commitments spread across more than 80 projects, which aim to
significantly improve the tools and techniques needed to access,
organize, and draw conclusions from huge volumes of digital data. The
initiative also challenged industry, research universities, and
nonprofits to join with the federal government to make the most of the
opportunities created by Big Data.

Motivated by the White House initiative and public suggestions, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) accepted the
challenge to stimulate collaboration among industry professionals to
further the secure and effective adoption of Big Data. As a result of
NIST's Cloud and Big Data Forum held on January 15--17, 2013, there was
strong encouragement for NIST to create a public working group for the
development of a Big Data Standards Roadmap. Forum participants noted
that this roadmap should define and prioritize Big Data requirements,
including interoperability, portability, reusability, extensibility,
data usage, analytics, and technology infrastructure. In doing so, the
roadmap would accelerate the adoption of the most secure and effective
Big Data techniques and technology.

On June 19, 2013, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) was
launched with extensive participation by industry, academia, and
government from across the nation. The scope of the NBD-PWG involves
forming a community of interests from all sectors---including industry,
academia, and government---with the goal of developing consensus on
definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, security and
privacy, and, from these, a standards roadmap. Such a consensus would
create a vendor-neutral, technology- and infrastructure-independent
framework that would enable Big Data stakeholders to identify and use
the best analytics tools for their processing and visualization
requirements on the most suitable computing platform and cluster, while
also allowing added value from Big Data service providers.


The *NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework (NBDIF)* was released in three versions, which correspond 
to the three stages of the NBD-PWG work. Version 3 (current version) of the NBDIF volumes resulted from 
Stage 3 work with major emphasis on the validation of the NBDRA Interfaces and content enhancement. Stage 
3 work built upon the foundation created during Stage 2 and Stage 1. The current effort documented in this 
volume reflects concepts developed within the rapidly evolving field of Big Data. The three stages 
(in reverse order) aim to achieve the following with respect to the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).

Stage 3: Validate the NBDRA by building Big Data general applications through the general interfaces;
Stage 2: Define general interfaces between the NBDRA components; and
Stage 1: Identify the high-level Big Data reference architecture key components, which are technology-, 
infrastructure-, and vendor-agnostic.

The NBDIF consists of nine volumes, each of which addresses a specific key topic, 
resulting from the work of the NBD-PWG. The nine volumes are as follows:

*	Volume 1, Definitions [@www-vol1-v3]
*	Volume 2, Taxonomies  [@www-vol2-v3]
*	Volume 3, Use Cases and General Requirements [@www-vol3-v3]
*	Volume 4, Security and Privacy [@www-vol4-v3]
*	Volume 5, Architectures White Paper Survey [@www-vol5-v3]
*	Volume 6, Reference Architecture [@www-vol6-v3]
*	Volume 7, Standards Roadmap [@www-vol7-v3]
*	Volume 8, Reference Architecture Interfaces (this volume) [@www-vol8-v3]
*	Volume 9, Adoption and Modernization [@www-vol9-v3]

During Stage 1, Volumes 1 through 7 were conceptualized, organized and
written. The finalized Version 1 documents can be downloaded from the
V1.0 Final Version page of the NBD-PWG website
[@www-nist-bdra-v1-wegpage].

During Stage 2, the NBD-PWG developed Version 2 of the NBDIF Version 1
volumes, with the exception of Volume 5, which contained the completed
architecture survey work that was used to inform Stage 1 work of the
NBD-PWG.  The goals of Version 2 were to enhance the Version 1
content, define general interfaces between the NBDRA components by
aggregating low-level interactions into high-level general interfaces,
and demonstrate how the NBDRA can be used. As a result of the Stage 2
work, the need for NBDIF Volume 8 and NBDIF Volume 9 were identified
and the two new volumes were created. Version 2 of the NBDIF volumes,
resulting from Stage 2 work, can be downloaded from the V2.0 Final
Version page of the NBD-PWG website [@www-nist-bdra-v2-wegpage].

## Version Management

Previous work that shaped the current version of this volumes and
are documented In GitHub [@nist-github-bdra-issues] with
prior versions of Volume 8 [@nist-vol8-hist][@nist-vol8-draft] and
Cloudmesh [@nist-cloudmesh] in support of the NIST Big Data
Architecture Framework [@www-bdra-working-group].
 
During the design phase and development period of each version of this
document, enhancements are managed through GitHub and community
contributions are managed via GitHub issues. This allows preservation
of the history of this document. When a new version is ready, the
version will be tagged in GitHub. Older versions will, through this
process, also be available as historical documents. Discussions about
objects in written form are communicated as GitHub issues.

## Interface Compliancy

Due to the easy extensibility of the resource objects specified in this 
document and their interfaces, it is important to introduce a 
terminology that allows the definition of interface compliancy. We define
three levels of interface compliance as follows:

* **Full Compliance:** These are reference implementations that provide
  full compliance to the objects defined in this document. A version
  number is added to assure that the snapshot in time of the
  objects is associated with the version. A full complient framework 
  implements all objects.

* **Partial Compliance:** These are reference implementations that provide
  partial compliance to the objects defined in this document. A
  version number will is added to assure that the snapshot in time of
  the objects is associated with the version. This reference
  implementation implements a partial list of the objects and interfaces. A
  document is to be added that specifies the differences to a full complient 
  implementation. 
  
* **Extended Compliance:** In addition to full and partial compliance 
  additional resources can be identified while documenting additional 
  resource objects and interfaces that are not included in the current 
  specification. The extended complience document can lead to additional 
  improvements of the current specification.

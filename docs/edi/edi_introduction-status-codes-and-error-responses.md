## Status Codes and Error Responses

In case of an error or a successful response, the response header
contains a HTTP code (see <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231>). The
response body usually contains the following:

- The HTTP response code;

- An accompanying message for the HTTP response code; and

- A field or object where the error occurred.
